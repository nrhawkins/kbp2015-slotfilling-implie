sentenceOffset/Text 3637: Dobelle said the 76 out-of-state trips he has taken in his 68 months as president were aimed at improving the lives of Westfield students, many of them ''throwaway kids,'' as he put it, with few advantages.


sentenceOffset/Text 4125: I do things for kids,'' said Dobelle, who acknowledged that he may have inadvertently charged personal expenses to the school or the foundation. ''


sentenceOffset/Text 4340: Dobelle also frequently combined personal and business travel, making his expenses difficult to disentangle.


sentenceOffset/Text 4780: But the state’s former longtime inspector general said Dobelle’s pattern of spending suggests a basic lack of restraint in the use of other people’s money, whether it’s from the foundation that provides about $250,000 a year for educational programs or from the university itself.

sentenceOffset/Text 8219: Even critics say that Dobelle has raised the aspirations and the stature of Westfield State.

Westfield State	westfield	city

sentenceOffset/Text 8312: Long a major producer of teachers and police officers, Westfield State recently changed its name from ''college’' to ''university’' to reflect broader ambitions, and Dobelle has set aside $3 million to hire new faculty.

Westfield State	westfield	city

sentenceOffset/Text 8668: Sure, Dobelle said, he could have built a standard dorm for a lot less than the $55 million University Hall -- with its elegant wood, brick, and glass exterior -- but he wanted an iconic building that reflected what students wanted. </P> <P> ''


sentenceOffset/Text 8912: I invest in things that have ROIs,'' said Dobelle, using the business jargon for return on investment.


sentenceOffset/Text 9197: From the start, however, it was clear Dobelle’s vision would be expensive.


sentenceOffset/Text 9474: We had a serious town-gown’' issue, said Dobelle. ''


sentenceOffset/Text 9608: So Dobelle set out to solve both problems, knowing it would cost millions.

sentenceOffset/Text 10607: But Dobelle said the only unusually expensive item was the luxury hotel bill in Bangkok, and there was a reason for it: The consultant who helped plan the trip said that Thai officials wouldn’t take Westfield State seriously if they didn’t put on a good show. </P> <P> ''

sentenceOffset/Text 10985: You better set yourself up in a way to show a certain degree of prominence and respect to them,'' recalled Dobelle. ''


sentenceOffset/Text 11143: But the combined effects of Dobelle’s extensive travel bills -- he charged $118,000 of the Asia trip to the foundation -- and the costs of the speakers’ series left the foundation unable to pay its bills, requiring a $425,000 loan from the university in 2010.


sentenceOffset/Text 11566: Moreover, board records show, foundation officials had a recurring problem with Dobelle not paying back clearly personal expenses -- such as travel costs for his wife or son -- for weeks, months, or even longer.


sentenceOffset/Text 11787: Dobelle said he voluntarily decided to give up his foundation credit card in late 2010 because both he and the clerical staff kept making mistakes about which bills were personal -- and had to be repaid -- and which were business. ''


sentenceOffset/Text 12020: I got tired of human error,'' Dobelle said. ''


sentenceOffset/Text 12151: â(euro) ‰’' </P> <P> But foundation records paint a different picture: On Sept. 21, 2010, Sheridan Carey, then chairman of the foundation board, wrote a letter to Dobelle and three other administrators who had foundation cards, saying that ''it is necessary to immediately halt credit card expenses’' in order to ''ensure the financial viability of the foundation.''

sentenceOffset/Text 12810: Dobelle said that, after he turned in his credit cards, he was determined to pay expenses personally and then seek reimbursement.


sentenceOffset/Text 13104: By mid-2011, Dobelle was charging thousands of dollars in business travel to San Francisco, Pittsburgh, and North Carolina on Salvidio’s card, along with other costly items such as $429 for a night at the Hyatt Harborside in Boston and $978 for a group luncheon at the Red Lion Inn in West Stockbridge.


sentenceOffset/Text 13526: In addition, Dobelle charged $875 for a personal trip to London on Salvidio’s card, a charge that he did not pay back for 15 months and that Dobelle now agrees was inappropriate.


sentenceOffset/Text 13714: In an interview, Dobelle struggled to explain why he used Salvidio’s card for his expenses even after he had gotten another university credit card of his own in 2011. </P> <P> ''


sentenceOffset/Text 13940: I’m not sure I can explain it,'' said Dobelle. ''


sentenceOffset/Text 14174: Now, Dobelle said the university’s reimbursement policy requires full documentation of every expenditure, and his staff said he pays back any personal items promptly.


sentenceOffset/Text 14350: However, the credit card policy hasn’t stopped Dobelle from charging luxury items to the Westfield State Foundation, the private fund-raising group.

sentenceOffset/Text 14499: When Dobelle’s old friend, retired George Washington University president Stephen Trachtenberg, spoke at a commencement for a small group of graduate students in 2012, Dobelle put him up at the luxurious Wheatleigh Hotel in Lenox, where rooms run from about $900 to $2,000 a night.

sentenceOffset/Text 15320: Johnson, a retired nonprofit executive, declined to discuss his resignation, but others said he was referring to Dobelle’s resistance to making public the details of his spending, which are contained in the review authorized by the trustees.


sentenceOffset/Text 15562: During Dobelle’s tenure, the amount spent by the foundation on scholarships and educational programs has gone down, according to foundation reports to the IRS, even as Dobelle’s discretionary spending has risen.


sentenceOffset/Text 15783: But Dobelle said, overall, Westfield State has prospered while he has been at the helm, rising in the US News and World Report rankings to 108th among regional universities in the north, while he has frozen tuition and increased university spending on financial aid by more than 50 percent.

sentenceOffset/Text 8301: Sure, Dobelle said, he could have built a standard dorm for a lot less than the $55 million University Hall -- with its elegant wood, brick, and glass exterior -- but he wanted an iconic building that reflected what students wanted. </P> <P> ''


sentenceOffset/Text 8545: I invest in things that have ROIs,'' said Dobelle, using the business jargon for return on investment.


sentenceOffset/Text 8830: From the start, however, it was clear Dobelle’s vision would be expensive.


sentenceOffset/Text 9107: We had a serious town-gown’' issue, said Dobelle. ''


sentenceOffset/Text 9241: So Dobelle set out to solve both problems, knowing it would cost millions.


sentenceOffset/Text 9748: But Dobelle said the series did its job, getting skeptical local residents to think ''Westfield State must be more than we thought it was.''


sentenceOffset/Text 9889: Meanwhile, Dobelle said he took the Westfield brand international, authorizing about $250,000 in foreign travel by Westfield State officials over the last few years.

sentenceOffset/Text 10064: Dobelle spent more on the 2008 Asia trip alone than the $92,000 that Governor Deval Patrick spent to take two dozen officials on a trade mission to Britain and Israel in 2011.

sentenceOffset/Text 10240: But Dobelle said the only unusually expensive item was the luxury hotel bill in Bangkok, and there was a reason for it: The consultant who helped plan the trip said that Thai officials wouldn’t take Westfield State seriously if they didn’t put on a good show. </P> <P> ''

sentenceOffset/Text 10618: You better set yourself up in a way to show a certain degree of prominence and respect to them,'' recalled Dobelle. ''


sentenceOffset/Text 10776: But the combined effects of Dobelle’s extensive travel bills -- he charged $118,000 of the Asia trip to the foundation -- and the costs of the speakers’ series left the foundation unable to pay its bills, requiring a $425,000 loan from the university in 2010.


sentenceOffset/Text 11199: Moreover, board records show, foundation officials had a recurring problem with Dobelle not paying back clearly personal expenses -- such as travel costs for his wife or son -- for weeks, months, or even longer.


sentenceOffset/Text 11420: Dobelle said he voluntarily decided to give up his foundation credit card in late 2010 because both he and the clerical staff kept making mistakes about which bills were personal -- and had to be repaid -- and which were business. ''


sentenceOffset/Text 11653: I got tired of human error,'' Dobelle said. ''


sentenceOffset/Text 11784: â(euro) ‰’' </P> <P> But foundation records paint a different picture: On Sept. 21, 2010, Sheridan Carey, then chairman of the foundation board, wrote a letter to Dobelle and three other administrators who had foundation cards, saying that ''it is necessary to immediately halt credit card expenses’' in order to ''ensure the financial viability of the foundation.''

sentenceOffset/Text 12443: Dobelle said that, after he turned in his credit cards, he was determined to pay expenses personally and then seek reimbursement.


sentenceOffset/Text 12737: By mid-2011, Dobelle was charging thousands of dollars in business travel to San Francisco, Pittsburgh, and North Carolina on Salvidio’s card, along with other costly items such as $429 for a night at the Hyatt Harborside in Boston and $978 for a group luncheon at the Red Lion Inn in West Stockbridge.


sentenceOffset/Text 13159: In addition, Dobelle charged $875 for a personal trip to London on Salvidio’s card, a charge that he did not pay back for 15 months and that Dobelle now agrees was inappropriate.


sentenceOffset/Text 13347: In an interview, Dobelle struggled to explain why he used Salvidio’s card for his expenses even after he had gotten another university credit card of his own in 2011. </P> <P> ''


sentenceOffset/Text 13573: I’m not sure I can explain it,'' said Dobelle. ''


sentenceOffset/Text 13807: Now, Dobelle said the university’s reimbursement policy requires full documentation of every expenditure, and his staff said he pays back any personal items promptly.


sentenceOffset/Text 13983: However, the credit card policy hasn’t stopped Dobelle from charging luxury items to the Westfield State Foundation, the private fund-raising group.

sentenceOffset/Text 14132: When Dobelle’s old friend, retired George Washington University president Stephen Trachtenberg, spoke at a commencement for a small group of graduate students in 2012, Dobelle put him up at the luxurious Wheatleigh Hotel in Lenox, where rooms run from about $900 to $2,000 a night.

sentenceOffset/Text 14423: Dobelle defends the accommodations, noting that Trachtenberg didn’t ask for a speaker’s fee.


sentenceOffset/Text 14953: Johnson, a retired nonprofit executive, declined to discuss his resignation, but others said he was referring to Dobelle’s resistance to making public the details of his spending, which are contained in the review authorized by the trustees.


sentenceOffset/Text 15195: During Dobelle’s tenure, the amount spent by the foundation on scholarships and educational programs has gone down, according to foundation reports to the IRS, even as Dobelle’s discretionary spending has risen.


sentenceOffset/Text 15416: But Dobelle said, overall, Westfield State has prospered while he has been at the helm, rising in the US News and World Report rankings to 108th among regional universities in the north, while he has frozen tuition and increased university spending on financial aid by more than 50 percent.

sentenceOffset/Text 172: SEEING SYLVIA PLATH WITH NEW EYES </HEADLINE> <TEXT> <P> This year, as anyone of a poetic temperament cannot fail to have noticed, is the 60th anniversary of Sylvia Plath’s suicide.


sentenceOffset/Text 547: Plath’s estranged husband, the poet Ted Hughes, published a version of “Ariel” in 1965, ordering and choosing its poems as he saw fit, assuring her posthumous fame – and directing the shape that fame would assume.

sentenceOffset/Text 1143: In the United States, she is also undergoing a kind of resurrection and image overhaul, spearheaded by young women and by poets, male and female, like Mark Wunderlich, who created a class at Bennington College a few years ago called “The Problem of Plath.”


sentenceOffset/Text 1745: Plath “is one of the first poets a lot of young women find who they can really claim as their own,” he said.


sentenceOffset/Text 2059: Sarah-Louise Smith, a 22-year-old Londoner, appeared to have tapped into that reservoir in 2011 when she founded the Twitter feed (AT)itssylviaplath, posting one or two Plath quotations every day.


sentenceOffset/Text 2631: In college, Dunham wrote, Plath’s “rhythmic, angry” language “rang in my head as I walked to class.”


sentenceOffset/Text 2732: She wondered “if Plath would have been saved had she been born in a different time: in a time when psycho-pharmacologists are no more shameful to visit than hairdressers.”


sentenceOffset/Text 2913: And last month, an illuminating biography was published by the poet Elizabeth Winder, “Pain, Parties, Work: Sylvia Plath in New York, Summer 1953,” which floods clarifying light on a chapter of the poet’s early life that Plath painted in jaundiced tones in “The Bell Jar.”

sentenceOffset/Text 3195: In 1953, Sylvia Plath was one of 20 talented, driven young women who won guest editorships at Mademoiselle magazine and were put up at the ladylike Barbizon hotel.


sentenceOffset/Text 3359: Mademoiselle at the time was the literary lighthouse of the women’s “slicks” (as Plath called them), publishing work by Dylan Thomas, W.H. Auden and Truman Capote.


sentenceOffset/Text 3523: The precocious Plath was singled out for star treatment by the editors, who recognized her brilliance but did not suspect her dark side.


sentenceOffset/Text 3755: Drawing from a trove of interviews, correspondence and diaries, Winder shows how selectively Plath edited that period, winnowing the positive, accentuating the negative, leaving out her thirst for glamour and fashion.


sentenceOffset/Text 3973: On the inside, Plath may have been a neurotic poet, but externally she was a cultivated, poised Smithie, determined to rise professionally and to shine socially.


sentenceOffset/Text 4294: The Ford model Janet Wagner, whom Plath nicknamed Pollyanna Cowgirl in “The Bell Jar,” saw Plath as an “Ivy League snob.”

sentenceOffset/Text 4863: This macabre end has overshadowed Plath’s legacy until now, but in March the poet Sandra Beasley convened a panel of poets in Boston to argue for a new understanding of Plath.

sentenceOffset/Text 5635: She thinks her younger sister, Christina, 23, is part of a new generation of women who are able to appreciate Plath not for her tragedy, but for her talent.


sentenceOffset/Text 5792: “For her, the draw of Plath is this Mademoiselle era; that’s the Plath she’s into,” Beasley said.


sentenceOffset/Text 5890: “I’m glad that what she relates to is Plath’s struggle to make her way in the professional world, not the fear that, no matter what she accomplishes, she might lose it the moment she enters a domestic role.”


sentenceOffset/Text 6287: While it’s impossible to forget how Plath lived and died, the question that today has fresh urgency is how she wrote.


sentenceOffset/Text 6405: Tracy K. Smith, who won the Pulitzer Prize last year for her poetry collection “Life on Mars,” said she felt indebted to Plath for the “framework of her poetry,” her balance of “extreme urgency of emotion with lyric precision and forms.”


sentenceOffset/Text 6643: Plath’s craft, she believes, deserves more attention.


sentenceOffset/Text 6823: “The primary thing about Plath that’s important to me as a poet is the expertise, the formal technique in her work,” she said.


sentenceOffset/Text 6950: “I think for all of us, Plath is a model.”
