sentenceOffset/Text 1931: Farimex contended in the lawsuit, which was filed in the Siberian town of Khanty-Mansiysk, that Telenor's representatives on the board of VimpelCom had neglected their fiduciary duty by opposing a plan to expand VimpelCom in Ukraine.

sentenceOffset/Text 58: SANDY ALDERSON ' S METS ASCENSION MAY NOT PLEASE ALL </HEADLINE> <TEXT> <P> Three weeks shy of his 63rd birthday, Sandy Alderson would appear to be at about the perfect stage of life for the task of running a Mets organization that in recent years has been simultaneously -- and sorely -- lacking in youthful discipline and adult erudition.


sentenceOffset/Text 408: By career standards, Alderson is old but -- unlike the Knicks' Donnie Walsh, who is pushing 70 -- not old enough to be thinking of his new general manager's role as a last lap around the block before settling into a rocking chair.

general manager's role	general manager	jobTitle

sentenceOffset/Text 819: But nor is Alderson a man on the professional make.


sentenceOffset/Text 955: When he moved to New York several years ago to work for Commissioner Bud Selig, Alderson was already financially endowed enough to choose a prime slice of Manhattan real estate at 49th Street and Second Avenue.

Commissioner Bud Selig	commissioner	jobTitle

sentenceOffset/Text 1300: The point is, the Mets needed Alderson a heck of a lot more than he needed them.


sentenceOffset/Text 1621: Alderson took it because he was intrigued by the location and the resources -- at least what he imagines those Bernie Madoff-challenged resources to be -- and because Selig promoted him to Wilpon for the chore of putting the Mets' tattered house in order.


sentenceOffset/Text 2166: So the best news for the demoralized and possibly dwindling faithful is that Alderson in all likelihood will not be too preoccupied with the complicated dynamic that is created when a father (Fred) builds a business and subsequently empowers an eager and ambitious son (Jeff) to oversee it.


sentenceOffset/Text 2466: Alderson, a grandfather, is a Harvard-trained lawyer with a championship pedigree and an unmistakable presence when he steps into a room.


sentenceOffset/Text 2806: Somehow it is difficult to imagine Jeff Wilpon's not thinking twice about interfering or usurping an Alderson operation based on his birthright -- at least with Alderson being as acquiescent as Omar Minaya was for the sake of midcareer preservation.


sentenceOffset/Text 3065: Oh, but we all had that wrong, Jeff Wilpon said, when asked Friday how his role and influence in the operation of the team might change now that someone with Alderson's credentials has come on board.


sentenceOffset/Text 4493: Alderson has come with a few issues of his own.


sentenceOffset/Text 4770: In those days, Alderson said, "we were fighting the last war," meaning recreational drugs, and that was as good an answer as any.


sentenceOffset/Text 4909: What kind of manager Alderson will pursue was also a favored topic Friday.

sentenceOffset/Text 5308: Alderson can't make the Wilpons spend money the way the Steinbrenners do.

sentenceOffset/Text 1624: That tantrum may have cost Lyle the captaincy of the European Ryder Cup team for this year, which eventually went to fellow Scot Colin Montgomerie, and he eventually apologized for his premature departure.


sentenceOffset/Text 1839: This time, Lyle stood his ground and he was rewarded with two straight pars at the 10th and 11th -- ironically the two toughest holes on the course.


sentenceOffset/Text 2124: Lyle finally limped in with a 14-over 86 and at 155 at the halfway stage, he was heading home to think again.


sentenceOffset/Text 2243: If it was any consolation to Lyle, he still finished nine strokes better off than Kiwi Michael Campbell, whose career has gone into an embarrassing tailspin since he won the 2005 US Open at Pinehurst.

sentenceOffset/Text 58: ANOTHER SPORT, ANOTHER CHANCE FOR WAGNER QUARTERBACK </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> NEW YORK </DATELINE> <TEXT> <P> Nick Doscher has returned to Staten Island, his home, and he has settled in as the 23-year-old starting sophomore quarterback at Wagner College, whose leafy campus sits like a tiara atop Grymes Hill.

WAGNER QUARTERBACK </HEADLINE> <DATELINE> NEW YORK </DATELINE> <TEXT> <P> Nick Doscher	new york	province

sentenceOffset/Text 456: Until two years ago -- June 8, 2008, to be precise -- Doscher was a catcher in the Kansas City Royals' farm system.

Kansas City Royals' farm system	kansas	province

sentenceOffset/Text 572: He remembers the date because the Royals cut him exactly three years after taking him in the eighth round of the amateur draft.


sentenceOffset/Text 709: Doscher turned 18 about three weeks before he was drafted, in 2005.


sentenceOffset/Text 922: The next day, he signed with the Royals.


sentenceOffset/Text 1145: Finally, Brian Rupp, his manager with the Burlington Bees in Iowa, called him into his office and told him the Royals were letting him go.

Brian Rupp, his manager	manager	jobTitle

sentenceOffset/Text 1293: "It's kind of a shock when it happens," Doscher said before football practice Thursday.


sentenceOffset/Text 1448: His father, also named Nick, who describes himself as a baseball lifer, was his coach at Moore Catholic and had insisted that the Royals pay for his son's college education as part of his contract.


sentenceOffset/Text 1655: The younger Nick Doscher was also a quarterback when he was at Moore Catholic, tall and sturdy and with a strong right arm.


sentenceOffset/Text 2076: He had not played football in a while when he enrolled, and Walt Hameline, Wagner's football coach for 30 years, thought Doscher might help the team -- as a 220-pound fullback.

Walt Hameline, Wagner's football coach	football coach	jobTitle

sentenceOffset/Text 2542: But Doscher won the starting quarterback job as a freshman and will lead the Seahawks (0-1) into their home opener Saturday.


sentenceOffset/Text 2898: Doscher has grown a thick beard, and sometimes his teammates will tease him by calling him an old man.


sentenceOffset/Text 3495: Like Doscher, another quarterback came out of the minor leagues: Chris Weinke spent six years as a first baseman in the Toronto Blue Jays' system before he enrolled at Florida State.

Florida State	florida	province

sentenceOffset/Text 3838: Doscher smiled when Weinke's name was brought up because he is a Florida fan, which, he said, means that he's no fan of Weinke.

Florida fan	florida	province

sentenceOffset/Text 3966: But Weinke's story can serve as an inspiration to Doscher -- not that he needs much to get going.


sentenceOffset/Text 4204: Doscher passed for 1,330 yards and eight touchdowns last season as a 22-year-old freshman and was named to the Northeast Conference first team.


sentenceOffset/Text 4348: As he directed an option-oriented offense, Doscher also rushed for 13 touchdowns and 769 yards, with 144 in a game against St. Francis of Pennsylvania.

game against St. Francis of Pennsylvania	pennsylvania	province

sentenceOffset/Text 4550: Crawford said being the centerpiece of the team did not seem to affect Doscher at all, perhaps because he was used to performing under pressure as a minor league baseball player.


sentenceOffset/Text 4908: Doscher is making the most of what has amounted to a second chance.


sentenceOffset/Text 5220: Although he is not that far from home, Doscher moved into a dorm room on campus and jumped into college life.


sentenceOffset/Text 5648: He caught Royals pitcher Zack Greinke on a rehabilitation assignment once.

sentenceOffset/Text 58: CADBURY BID UNDER STUDY AT HERSHEY </HEADLINE> <TEXT> <P> Hershey, after months of internal debate, is now considering a bid for the British candy maker Cadbury, a move that would challenge Kraft's existing $16.7 billion hostile offer for the company, according to people briefed on the matter.

British candy maker Cadbury	british	nationality

sentenceOffset/Text 743: Working in Hershey's favor is Cadbury's reluctance to team up with Kraft.


sentenceOffset/Text 826: Even before Kraft made its hostile approach in September, Hershey had been considering its options, including a potential merger with Cadbury.


sentenceOffset/Text 969: The two already share ties: Hershey makes and distributes Cadbury products like Creme Eggs in the United States.


sentenceOffset/Text 1091: Hershey had long assumed that it could not afford to strike a deal on its own, especially because Kraft had already locked up nine banks to provide a $9.2 billion loan.


sentenceOffset/Text 1260: But with the financing markets having opened up this year, Hershey may become emboldened to take that step.


sentenceOffset/Text 1377: Many analysts and deal-makers had thought the chances of Hershey's challenging Kraft were slim.


sentenceOffset/Text 1473: Hershey's market value as of Friday was about $8.5 billion, a fraction of Kraft's $40.1 billion value.


sentenceOffset/Text 1585: Hershey also had only $119 million in cash on hand as of Oct. 4, although it had about $1.7 billion in total debt, leaving it with the ability to borrow a considerable sum.

sentenceOffset/Text 58: CADBURY BID UNDER STUDY AT HERSHEY </HEADLINE> <TEXT> <P> Hershey, after months of internal debate, is now considering a bid for the British candy maker Cadbury, a move that would challenge Kraft's existing $16.7 billion hostile offer for the company, according to people briefed on the matter.

British candy maker Cadbury	british	nationality

sentenceOffset/Text 686: Kraft has so far emerged as the only suitor for Cadbury, and were it to succeed it would become an international food giant that could threaten Hershey's expansion prospects.


sentenceOffset/Text 861: Working in Hershey's favor is Cadbury's reluctance to team up with Kraft, which the British company has derided as a low-growth food conglomerate that would stunt its opportunities.

British company	british	nationality

sentenceOffset/Text 1052: Even before Kraft made its hostile approach in September, Hershey had been considering its options, including a potential merger with Cadbury.


sentenceOffset/Text 1195: The two already share ties: Hershey makes and distributes Cadbury products like Creme Eggs in the United States.


sentenceOffset/Text 1317: Hershey had long assumed that it could not afford to strike a deal on its own, especially because Kraft had already locked up nine banks to provide a $9.2 billion loan.


sentenceOffset/Text 1486: But with the financing markets having opened up this year, Hershey may become emboldened to take that step.


sentenceOffset/Text 1603: In the past, Hershey has been restrained in business matters by the Hershey Trust, a 104-year-old charitable organization that oversees the Milton Hershey School, an institution for underprivileged children in Pennsylvania.


sentenceOffset/Text 1827: Because of the trust, which controls about 79 percent of the company's voting shares, and local opposition, Hershey scuttled a $12.5 billion sale to the Wm. Wrigley Jr.


sentenceOffset/Text 2068: Many analysts and deal-makers had thought the chances of Hershey's challenging Kraft were slim.


sentenceOffset/Text 2164: Hershey's market value as of Friday was about $8.5 billion, a fraction of Kraft's $40.1 billion value.


sentenceOffset/Text 2276: Hershey also had only $119 million in cash on hand as of Oct. 4, although it had about $1.7 billion in total debt, leaving it with the ability to borrow a considerable sum.


sentenceOffset/Text 2578: Hershey shares edged up 4 cents on Friday, to $37.18, before reports broke about its serious consideration of a deal.


sentenceOffset/Text 3611: If Hershey were to leap into the contest, it would try to reach a friendly deal with Cadbury, according to one person briefed on the matter.


sentenceOffset/Text 3752: Behind the scenes, people close to Hershey have held talks with representatives for Cadbury, although there have been no formal negotiations.


sentenceOffset/Text 3903: Besides JPMorgan and Bank of America, Hershey has also been working with Byron D. Trott, the former Goldman Sachs executive long known as Buffett's favorite banker.

JPMorgan and Bank of America	america	nationality

sentenceOffset/Text 4068: But because of Buffett's position in Kraft, he is unlikely to give Hershey any help.


sentenceOffset/Text 4162: Hershey also has held talks with Ferrero, the family-controlled Italian confectioner that makes Rocher chocolates and Tic Tac mints, people briefed on the matter said.

sentenceOffset/Text 4534: Complicating Hershey's deliberations is the Hershey Trust, which has served in the past largely as a brake on Hershey's boldest business decisions.


sentenceOffset/Text 4805: But local opposition -- including from Pennsylvania's attorney general at the time, residents of Hershey's hometown and alumni of the Hershey school -- persuaded a state court judge to criticize the trust's decision as an abandonment of its mission.

sentenceOffset/Text 1525: According to scholar Gerald Nordland, a friend of Diebenkorn's, the artist was certain that his role was to render deeply felt experience, divorced from objects, figures, stories and nostalgia for the daily world.

sentenceOffset/Text 3893: As Nordland said, Diebenkorn knew what to do with the influence.

sentenceOffset/Text 436: The Securities and Exchange Commission also accused two other former executives of Countrywide of civil fraud, saying they and Mozilo "deliberately" misled investors about the risks the company assumed in its aggressive drive for a share of the booming mortgage market.

sentenceOffset/Text 842: The company became the largest mortgage lender in the country, generating hundreds of millions of dollars of wealth for Mozilo, the perpetually tanned son of a Bronx butcher.


sentenceOffset/Text 1390: Mozilo's lawyer declined to comment.

sentenceOffset/Text 1587: Most of that amount is designed to pay former Countrywide investors who were harmed by the alleged wrongdoing, and will be paid by Bank of America under a Countrywide indemnification agreement with Mozilo.

sentenceOffset/Text 1793: Mozilo is paying about $23 million out of his own pocket as a penalty.

sentenceOffset/Text 2862: Unlike Ebbers and Milken, Mozilo's settlement with the SEC is civil and he faces no jail time.


sentenceOffset/Text 3126: The SEC announced the charges against Mozilo in June 2009, and the settlement comes days before a trial was to begin in Los Angeles.


sentenceOffset/Text 3259: Mozilo was accused of misleading shareholders and netting $140 million in personal profit from insider trading.


sentenceOffset/Text 3635: For Mozilo, it would have been an early evaluation of the evidence that could be used by prosecutors in a potential criminal trial.


sentenceOffset/Text 4111: The SEC charged that Mozilo and two other executives told Countrywide's shareholders that the firm wasn't partaking in the risky mortgage lending practices of competitors, when in fact it was radically reducing the standards it used to make loans.


docName: LTW_ENG_20090605.0127


sentenceOffset/Text 493: In a fraud and insider-trading lawsuit against Mozilo, the Securities and Exchange Commission quotes e-mails in which the executive derided certain Countrywide loan products as "toxic" and "poison" more than three years ago -- well before "toxic debt" entered the popular lexicon as the cause of the housing crash and the resulting global financial crisis and deep recession.


sentenceOffset/Text 878: "In all my years in the business I have never seen a more toxic product," Mozilo said in an April 2006 message, cited in the suit, about Countrywide's loans requiring no down payments from borrowers with abysmal credit.


sentenceOffset/Text 1173: But Mozilo never advised shareholders just how lax the nation's No.1 mortgage lender's standards had become, according to the lawsuit, filed in federal court in Los Angeles.


sentenceOffset/Text 1873: Lawyers for Mozilo, Sambol and Sieracki vehemently denied wrongdoing by their clients, suggested the e-mails were taken out of context and called the suit a political response to outrage over the government's failure to prevent the mortgage meltdown that began in late 2007 and the economic pain that has followed.


sentenceOffset/Text 2197: "The lawsuit filed today by the SEC does not reflect a balanced or fair consideration of the facts or the law," David Siegel, a lawyer for Mozilo, said, denying that the executive "knew about some undisclosed risk."

David Siegel, a lawyer	lawyer	jobTitle

sentenceOffset/Text 3857: Mozilo and the others "painted a mirage for investors," SEC enforcement chief Khuzami said.

sentenceOffset/Text 1699: Filled with stories ranging from the hilarious to the horrific, Mathews reveals how his devotion to fighting cruelty stems from the gay- bashing he endured as an adolescent, and how he managed to pull off some of his most outrageous, controversial, and effective campaigns.


sentenceOffset/Text 2544: Among Mathews' topics of discussion:  ·    How getting beaten up as a youth sensitized him to the plight of animals, and how it helped him develop a thick skin for the lifelong adversity he faces as a controversial activist ·    How he conceived his most provocative protests; he's been jailed around the world in odd costumes and sometimes nude.


sentenceOffset/Text 3640: We hope you will take this opportunity to speak with him: Mathews will be on tour this April and is available in studio or via phone.

sentenceOffset/Text 482: Ravetch and his wife, Harriet Frank Jr., met as young writers at MGM and married in 1946 but did not begin collaborating until a decade or so later, when they worked together on an adaptation of William Faulkner's novel "The Hamlet."


sentenceOffset/Text 1220: There was not much left of the novel in the final film -- "10 percent Faulkner" was Ravetch's assessment -- though Faulkner was said to have liked it.


sentenceOffset/Text 1760: The factual spine of "Norma Rae" (1979), about the effort of a Southern mill worker (Sally Field) to unionize her workplace, came from the life of a real North Carolinian, Crystal Lee Jordan, whom Ravetch and Frank discovered when producers brought them a copy of a book about her, "Crystal Lee: A Woman of Inheritance," by Henry P. Leifermann.

sentenceOffset/Text 4169: For the first 10 years of his marriage, Ravetch was a freelance screenwriter, specializing in Westerns, but his aspiration was to write for the stage.


sentenceOffset/Text 4454: In 1953 another of Ravetch's plays, variously titled "Where Late the Sweet Birds Sang" and "A Certain Joy," was being shepherded toward Broadway by the producer Kermit Bloomgarden, with Walter Matthau as its star, when it was canceled on the verge of its opening.


sentenceOffset/Text 4727: When Ravetch and Frank decided to collaborate, she was working as a script polisher for different studios and writing comic short stories for Collier's, The Saturday Evening Post and elsewhere.


sentenceOffset/Text 5051: "Movies can't correct human injustice all by themselves, but they can show it, they can touch you while showing it, and they can seed ideas and wake up dormant minds," Ravetch said.

sentenceOffset/Text 58: PANEL URGES AVASTIN USE BE LIMITED </HEADLINE> <TEXT> <P> An advisory committee recommended Tuesday that the Food and Drug Administration revoke approval of the drug Avastin as a treatment for breast cancer, saying the drug was not helping patients.


sentenceOffset/Text 317: The 12 to 1 vote represents a stinging setback for Avastin, which is now the world's best-selling cancer drug, with global sales of about $6 billion last year.


sentenceOffset/Text 1077: Avastin, which is sold by Roche's Genentech unit, will remain on the market even if the FDA follows the committee's advice, as it usually does.


sentenceOffset/Text 1221: That is because Avastin is also permitted as a treatment for colon, lung, kidney and brain cancers.


sentenceOffset/Text 1321: So even if the FDA does indeed take the rare move of rescinding its approval, doctors would still be able to use Avastin off label to treat breast cancer.


sentenceOffset/Text 1553: And breast cancer treatment would no longer be part of a program in which Genentech caps yearly spending on Avastin at $57,000 for patients with incomes below $100,000.


sentenceOffset/Text 1722: Without the cap, the wholesale price of Avastin for a typical breast cancer patient would be $88,000, according to Genentech.


sentenceOffset/Text 1857: Avastin, also known as bevacizumab, is Roche's best-selling product.


sentenceOffset/Text 2229: Genentech, in a statement, said it stood by the data and said that "Avastin should be an option for patients with this incurable disease."


sentenceOffset/Text 2446: Avastin was given so-called accelerated approval in early 2008, a way for the FDA to approve drugs for life-threatening diseases based on less than complete evidence of effectiveness.


sentenceOffset/Text 3227: But use of Avastin did not prolong the women's lives by a statistically significant amount, the gold standard for cancer drugs.


sentenceOffset/Text 3421: The two new studies, in which different chemotherapy drugs were used with Avastin, showed even fewer signs that it could prolong lives.


sentenceOffset/Text 4011: Even patient groups were split when Avastin initially came up for approval for use in metastatic breast cancer.


sentenceOffset/Text 4907: For lung cancer and colon cancer, Avastin improved survival and got full approval.

sentenceOffset/Text 58: PANEL URGES AVASTIN USE BE LIMITED </HEADLINE> <TEXT> <P> An advisory committee recommended Tuesday that the Food and Drug Administration revoke approval of the drug Avastin as a treatment for breast cancer, saying the drug was not helping patients.


sentenceOffset/Text 317: The 12 to 1 vote represents a stinging setback for Avastin, which is now the world's best-selling cancer drug, with global sales of about $6 billion last year.


sentenceOffset/Text 1076: Avastin, which is sold by Roche's Genentech unit, will remain on the market even if the FDA follows the committee's advice, as it usually does.


sentenceOffset/Text 1220: That is because Avastin is also permitted as a treatment for colon, lung, kidney and brain cancers.


sentenceOffset/Text 1329: Genentech, in a statement, said it stood by the data and said that "Avastin should be an option for patients with this incurable disease."


sentenceOffset/Text 1550: Avastin was given so-called accelerated approval in early 2008, a way for the FDA to approve drugs for life-threatening diseases based on less than complete evidence of effectiveness.


sentenceOffset/Text 2236: But use of Avastin did not prolong the women's lives by a statistically significant amount, and the drug had serious side effects for some patients.


sentenceOffset/Text 2394: The two new studies, in which different chemotherapy drugs were used with Avastin, showed even fewer signs that it could prolong lives.


sentenceOffset/Text 2945: For lung cancer and colon cancer, Avastin improved survival and got full approval.
