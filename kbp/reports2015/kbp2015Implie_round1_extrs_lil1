sentenceOffset/Text 58: SANDY ALDERSON ' S METS ASCENSION MAY NOT PLEASE ALL </HEADLINE> <TEXT> <P> Three weeks shy of his 63rd birthday, Sandy Alderson would appear to be at about the perfect stage of life for the task of running a Mets organization that in recent years has been simultaneously -- and sorely -- lacking in youthful discipline and adult erudition.


sentenceOffset/Text 408: By career standards, Alderson is old but -- unlike the Knicks' Donnie Walsh, who is pushing 70 -- not old enough to be thinking of his new general manager's role as a last lap around the block before settling into a rocking chair.

general manager's role	general manager	jobTitle

sentenceOffset/Text 819: But nor is Alderson a man on the professional make.


sentenceOffset/Text 955: When he moved to New York several years ago to work for Commissioner Bud Selig, Alderson was already financially endowed enough to choose a prime slice of Manhattan real estate at 49th Street and Second Avenue.

Commissioner Bud Selig	commissioner	jobTitle

sentenceOffset/Text 1300: The point is, the Mets needed Alderson a heck of a lot more than he needed them.


sentenceOffset/Text 1621: Alderson took it because he was intrigued by the location and the resources -- at least what he imagines those Bernie Madoff-challenged resources to be -- and because Selig promoted him to Wilpon for the chore of putting the Mets' tattered house in order.


sentenceOffset/Text 2166: So the best news for the demoralized and possibly dwindling faithful is that Alderson in all likelihood will not be too preoccupied with the complicated dynamic that is created when a father (Fred) builds a business and subsequently empowers an eager and ambitious son (Jeff) to oversee it.


sentenceOffset/Text 2466: Alderson, a grandfather, is a Harvard-trained lawyer with a championship pedigree and an unmistakable presence when he steps into a room.


sentenceOffset/Text 2806: Somehow it is difficult to imagine Jeff Wilpon's not thinking twice about interfering or usurping an Alderson operation based on his birthright -- at least with Alderson being as acquiescent as Omar Minaya was for the sake of midcareer preservation.


sentenceOffset/Text 3065: Oh, but we all had that wrong, Jeff Wilpon said, when asked Friday how his role and influence in the operation of the team might change now that someone with Alderson's credentials has come on board.


sentenceOffset/Text 4493: Alderson has come with a few issues of his own.


sentenceOffset/Text 4770: In those days, Alderson said, "we were fighting the last war," meaning recreational drugs, and that was as good an answer as any.


sentenceOffset/Text 4909: What kind of manager Alderson will pursue was also a favored topic Friday.

sentenceOffset/Text 5308: Alderson can't make the Wilpons spend money the way the Steinbrenners do.

sentenceOffset/Text 58: AN 84-YEAR-OLD WISECRACKER KEEPS TRUCKING </HEADLINE> <TEXT> <P> Friends of Elaine Stritch, the Broadway legend, have expressed surprise that, at 84, she is acting this summer in a small role in "The Full Monty" at the Paper Mill Playhouse in suburban Millburn, N.J.


sentenceOffset/Text 480: But after performing for the last several years in her autobiographical, Tony Award-winning show "Elaine Stritch at Liberty," Stritch says the "Monty" role of the hard-drinking piano player Jeanette Burmeister has been an inspiration and a blast.

sentenceOffset/Text 1887: "Everyone thinks that a wisecracker like Jeanette is right up my alley, but that doesn't mean it's easy, not at all," said Stritch, wearing girlish short shorts and a sweater vest as she drank a Buckler nonalcoholic beer.


sentenceOffset/Text 2503: Besides, unlike Estelle Parsons, who, also in her 80s, spent 90 minutes onstage in the role of Violet Weston in the recently ended Broadway production of "August: Osage County," Stritch spends a relatively brief 20 minutes of the two-and-a-half-hour show onstage.

sentenceOffset/Text 5630: Though Stritch does not go on until 50 minutes into the musical, she arrives at the theater early and has her hair and makeup ready by call time.


sentenceOffset/Text 5978: "I'm a diabetic, so if I get home at midnight from the Paper Mill, I have to stay up till 3:30 or 4 a.m. to take my proper doses of insulin and my proper amounts of food," Stritch said.

sentenceOffset/Text 58: CADBURY BID UNDER STUDY AT HERSHEY </HEADLINE> <TEXT> <P> Hershey, after months of internal debate, is now considering a bid for the British candy maker Cadbury, a move that would challenge Kraft's existing $16.7 billion hostile offer for the company, according to people briefed on the matter.

British candy maker Cadbury	british	nationality

sentenceOffset/Text 743: Working in Hershey's favor is Cadbury's reluctance to team up with Kraft.


sentenceOffset/Text 826: Even before Kraft made its hostile approach in September, Hershey had been considering its options, including a potential merger with Cadbury.


sentenceOffset/Text 969: The two already share ties: Hershey makes and distributes Cadbury products like Creme Eggs in the United States.


sentenceOffset/Text 1091: Hershey had long assumed that it could not afford to strike a deal on its own, especially because Kraft had already locked up nine banks to provide a $9.2 billion loan.


sentenceOffset/Text 1260: But with the financing markets having opened up this year, Hershey may become emboldened to take that step.


sentenceOffset/Text 1377: Many analysts and deal-makers had thought the chances of Hershey's challenging Kraft were slim.


sentenceOffset/Text 1473: Hershey's market value as of Friday was about $8.5 billion, a fraction of Kraft's $40.1 billion value.


sentenceOffset/Text 1585: Hershey also had only $119 million in cash on hand as of Oct. 4, although it had about $1.7 billion in total debt, leaving it with the ability to borrow a considerable sum.


sentenceOffset/Text 1887: Hershey shares edged up 4 cents on Friday, to $37.18, before reports broke about its serious consideration of a deal.


sentenceOffset/Text 2178: If Hershey were to leap into the contest, it would try to reach a friendly deal with Cadbury, according to one person briefed on the matter.


sentenceOffset/Text 2328: Hershey also has held talks with Ferrero, the family-controlled Italian confectioner that makes Rocher chocolates and Tic Tac mints, people briefed on the matter said.

sentenceOffset/Text 535: The company, maker of Hershey's kisses, Reese's peanut candies and other confections, said it is reserving the right to participate in a Cadbury offer within six months if some conditions are met.


sentenceOffset/Text 741: In order for Hershey to make an offer or be part of one in that time frame, Cadbury's board must approve of such action -- assuming Kraft's bid has not become wholly unconditional.


sentenceOffset/Text 922: Hershey also may make an offer if a third-party bid comes in, if a reverse takeover is announced or if there is another material change of circumstances.

sentenceOffset/Text 58: CADBURY BID UNDER STUDY AT HERSHEY </HEADLINE> <TEXT> <P> Hershey, after months of internal debate, is now considering a bid for the British candy maker Cadbury, a move that would challenge Kraft's existing $16.7 billion hostile offer for the company, according to people briefed on the matter.

British candy maker Cadbury	british	nationality

sentenceOffset/Text 686: Kraft has so far emerged as the only suitor for Cadbury, and were it to succeed it would become an international food giant that could threaten Hershey's expansion prospects.


sentenceOffset/Text 861: Working in Hershey's favor is Cadbury's reluctance to team up with Kraft, which the British company has derided as a low-growth food conglomerate that would stunt its opportunities.

British company	british	nationality

sentenceOffset/Text 1052: Even before Kraft made its hostile approach in September, Hershey had been considering its options, including a potential merger with Cadbury.


sentenceOffset/Text 1195: The two already share ties: Hershey makes and distributes Cadbury products like Creme Eggs in the United States.


sentenceOffset/Text 1317: Hershey had long assumed that it could not afford to strike a deal on its own, especially because Kraft had already locked up nine banks to provide a $9.2 billion loan.


sentenceOffset/Text 1486: But with the financing markets having opened up this year, Hershey may become emboldened to take that step.


sentenceOffset/Text 1603: In the past, Hershey has been restrained in business matters by the Hershey Trust, a 104-year-old charitable organization that oversees the Milton Hershey School, an institution for underprivileged children in Pennsylvania.


sentenceOffset/Text 1827: Because of the trust, which controls about 79 percent of the company's voting shares, and local opposition, Hershey scuttled a $12.5 billion sale to the Wm. Wrigley Jr.


sentenceOffset/Text 2068: Many analysts and deal-makers had thought the chances of Hershey's challenging Kraft were slim.


sentenceOffset/Text 2164: Hershey's market value as of Friday was about $8.5 billion, a fraction of Kraft's $40.1 billion value.


sentenceOffset/Text 2276: Hershey also had only $119 million in cash on hand as of Oct. 4, although it had about $1.7 billion in total debt, leaving it with the ability to borrow a considerable sum.


sentenceOffset/Text 2578: Hershey shares edged up 4 cents on Friday, to $37.18, before reports broke about its serious consideration of a deal.


sentenceOffset/Text 3611: If Hershey were to leap into the contest, it would try to reach a friendly deal with Cadbury, according to one person briefed on the matter.


sentenceOffset/Text 3752: Behind the scenes, people close to Hershey have held talks with representatives for Cadbury, although there have been no formal negotiations.


sentenceOffset/Text 3903: Besides JPMorgan and Bank of America, Hershey has also been working with Byron D. Trott, the former Goldman Sachs executive long known as Buffett's favorite banker.

JPMorgan and Bank of America	america	nationality

sentenceOffset/Text 4068: But because of Buffett's position in Kraft, he is unlikely to give Hershey any help.


sentenceOffset/Text 4162: Hershey also has held talks with Ferrero, the family-controlled Italian confectioner that makes Rocher chocolates and Tic Tac mints, people briefed on the matter said.

Ferrero, the family-controlled Italian confectioner	italian	nationality

sentenceOffset/Text 4534: Complicating Hershey's deliberations is the Hershey Trust, which has served in the past largely as a brake on Hershey's boldest business decisions.


sentenceOffset/Text 4805: But local opposition -- including from Pennsylvania's attorney general at the time, residents of Hershey's hometown and alumni of the Hershey school -- persuaded a state court judge to criticize the trust's decision as an abandonment of its mission.

sentenceOffset/Text 1525: According to scholar Gerald Nordland, a friend of Diebenkorn's, the artist was certain that his role was to render deeply felt experience, divorced from objects, figures, stories and nostalgia for the daily world.


sentenceOffset/Text 2093: What Diebenkorn did was focus on spontaneity and improvisation, attempting to work below the level of the conscious mind.


sentenceOffset/Text 2346: For Diebenkorn, the challenge was the exploration of himself.


sentenceOffset/Text 2573: Nordland told me last week that he had stacks of notebooks filled with quotes, interviews and observations about Diebenkorn (the artist would never allow his interviews to be taped nor would he allow himself to be photographed while painting).


sentenceOffset/Text 2818: Nordland said that painting for Diebenkorn involved a frenzy of emotional activity followed by quiet study from across the room and that Diebenkorn admitted that he was forced to strive to an extent that embarrassed him.


sentenceOffset/Text 3190: All work was created between January 1950 and June 1952 while Diebenkorn was a graduate student in the art department at the University of New Mexico.


sentenceOffset/Text 3375: Diebenkorn told Nordland that &quot;Albuquerque 3, 1951&quot; was his breakthrough work.


sentenceOffset/Text 3464: Diebenkorn said he painted it with the paint remaining on the brushes from the day before.


sentenceOffset/Text 3555: The painting came after Diebenkorn had returned from his first flight over the desert.


sentenceOffset/Text 3643: &quot;The aerial view showed me such a variety of ways of treating a flat plane, like flattened mud or paint,&quot; Diebenkorn said to Nordland.


sentenceOffset/Text 3789: The flight took Diebenkorn to San Francisco where he visited the memorial exhibition for Arshile Gorky.


sentenceOffset/Text 3893: As Nordland said, Diebenkorn knew what to do with the influence.


sentenceOffset/Text 3959: One can see influences in the work of Diebenkorn, but what is so compelling about his paintings is the unique expression of himself.


sentenceOffset/Text 4239: There is clearly a New Mexico landscape influence on the work in this exhibition, but these are not landscapes.

sentenceOffset/Text 4464: In Albuquerque I relaxed and began to think of natural forms in relation to my own feelings,&quot; Diebenkorn said.

sentenceOffset/Text 740: Graham's attorney, John Murphy, countered in his opening statement that the prosecution lacked a murder weapon, fingerprints or other physical evidence to link Graham with Aquash's killing or the site of her death.


sentenceOffset/Text 964: Graham, a Southern Tutchone tribal member from Canada, is charged with first- and second-degree murder.

sentenceOffset/Text 1260: Family members and observers have said Graham's trial could help answer lingering questions about why Aquash died and who ordered her killing.


sentenceOffset/Text 1412: During his narrative about what the state believes happened, Jackley told jurors that Graham and two other AIM activists, Arlo Looking Cloud and Theda Clark, were told in late 1975 to take Aquash from Denver to Rapid City, to the apartment of Thelma Rios.


sentenceOffset/Text 1677: Graham, Looking Cloud and Clark then took Aquash to the Rosebud and Pine Ridge reservations, and eventually stopped near a highway on Pine Ridge, Jackley said.


sentenceOffset/Text 1846: "John Graham knew the task at hand and he got out of the vehicle," Jackley said.


sentenceOffset/Text 1927: The prosecutor said Graham then shot Aquash in the back of the head as Looking Cloud stood nearby.


sentenceOffset/Text 2035: Looking Cloud was found guilty of his involvement in the murder in 2004 and will likely testify at Graham's trial.


sentenceOffset/Text 3709: Jackley said witnesses would show that AIM leaders considered Aquash dangerous and that Graham later suggested he felt remorse for the crime.


sentenceOffset/Text 3860: Murphy questioned the credibility of two witnesses he said were central to the prosecution's case: Looking Cloud and Serle Chapman, a British journalist who interviewed Graham and cooperated with the FBI.

89, SCREENWRITER OF ' HUD	screenwriter	jobTitle
Hollywood's most successful husband-and-wife screenwriting teams	hollywood	city

sentenceOffset/Text 482: Ravetch and his wife, Harriet Frank Jr., met as young writers at MGM and married in 1946 but did not begin collaborating until a decade or so later, when they worked together on an adaptation of William Faulkner's novel "The Hamlet."


sentenceOffset/Text 1220: There was not much left of the novel in the final film -- "10 percent Faulkner" was Ravetch's assessment -- though Faulkner was said to have liked it.


sentenceOffset/Text 1760: The factual spine of "Norma Rae" (1979), about the effort of a Southern mill worker (Sally Field) to unionize her workplace, came from the life of a real North Carolinian, Crystal Lee Jordan, whom Ravetch and Frank discovered when producers brought them a copy of a book about her, "Crystal Lee: A Woman of Inheritance," by Henry P. Leifermann.

sentenceOffset/Text 2246: "We have found, as screenwriters, we've often needed an outside story to get us started," Ravetch said in an introduction to a collection of their work.

sentenceOffset/Text 4169: For the first 10 years of his marriage, Ravetch was a freelance screenwriter, specializing in Westerns, but his aspiration was to write for the stage.


sentenceOffset/Text 4454: In 1953 another of Ravetch's plays, variously titled "Where Late the Sweet Birds Sang" and "A Certain Joy," was being shepherded toward Broadway by the producer Kermit Bloomgarden, with Walter Matthau as its star, when it was canceled on the verge of its opening.


sentenceOffset/Text 4727: When Ravetch and Frank decided to collaborate, she was working as a script polisher for different studios and writing comic short stories for Collier's, The Saturday Evening Post and elsewhere.


sentenceOffset/Text 5051: "Movies can't correct human injustice all by themselves, but they can show it, they can touch you while showing it, and they can seed ideas and wake up dormant minds," Ravetch said.
